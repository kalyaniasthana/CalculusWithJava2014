Code for Reimann Mid Point Sum in Java:
I have written this code to find the approximate area under a curve i.e. a function of variable x.To find the area I used the Reimann mid point sum rule.
According to this rule :
Approximating f at the midpoint of intervals gives f(a + Q/2) for the first interval, for the next one f(a + 3Q/2), and so on untilf(b âˆ’ Q/2). Summing up the areas gives

In this formula values of x range from a to b.
(b-a/n) is called the step size i.e. increase in every consecutive value of x.
In the above formula step size is represented by Q.
Using this formula we partition the interval of integration into rectangles each of who's length is the value of function at the mid point of two consecutive x values and breadth is the step size.
In the code that I have written,I have defined the step size as deltax and f(x) as function(x).
First method of the code i.e. function() initializes the function.
Second method of the code i.e. area() computes the value of area under the curve using a for loop.
The value of variable sum and variable x s calculated inside the loop.
I have calculated every other value of x using the above formula.Value of x keeps on increasing in multiples of step size divided by 2.
At the end of the loop the final value of x is put inside the function and then it is multiplied by the step size to give the total areas of all rectangles under the curve.
